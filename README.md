Falling Star it's a Interactive movie focusing on narrative gameplay, the player have four days before a meteorite falls down on earth, restarting the life cycle, within the four days, player can visit the family that remembers, an old love, a beloved friend or stay alone, all actions takes a day, so you should choose wisely the order.

All the game bases on Kubler-Ross Grief Cycle, as the emotional states represent a wave (on my perspective) from a active - passive emotional response against time.

This is a fast up readme, don't judge me please.
